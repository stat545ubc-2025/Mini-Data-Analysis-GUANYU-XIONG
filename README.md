\# Mini Data Analysis Project – STAT 545A



This repository contains my mini data analysis project for STAT 545A.  

The project uses datasets from the `datateachr` package and focuses on data wrangling, tidying, and visualization in R. The main dataset I chose to explore in detail is \*\*`apt\_buildings`\*\*, which contains information on apartment buildings in Toronto.



\## How to Use This Repository



\- The analysis is documented in R Markdown (`.Rmd`) files.  

\- To follow along, open the `.Rmd` file in RStudio and knit it to a GitHub document (`.md`).  

\- The knitted `.md` files are also included in the repo, so you can read the results directly on GitHub without running any code.  

\- All code uses the \*\*tidyverse\*\* approach (`dplyr`, `ggplot2`, etc.), consistent with what we learned in STAT 545A.  



\## Contents



\- `mini-project-1.Rmd` / `mini-project-1.md`: Milestone 1 – choosing datasets, exploring structure, visualizing distributions, handling missing values, and exploring relationships between variables.  

\- Additional files will appear here as the project progresses.

This project demonstrates fundamental data wrangling, tidying, and visualization skills in R using real-world open datasets.
